ingredients:
 - 2 sweet potatoes, peeled and sliced into 1 inch long, ½ inch wide chunks
 - 1 red bell pepper, cored, deseeded, and sliced into bite-sized strips
 - about 2 tablespoons coconut oil (or olive oil)
 - ¼ teaspoon cumin powder
 - Sea salt, to taste
directions:
 - On a large, rimmed baking sheet, toss the sweet potato with a generous tablespoon of coconut oil, the cumin and a sprinkle of salt.
 - Arrange them in a single layer, and set aside.
 - On a separate, smaller baking sheet, toss the bell pepper with about 1 teaspoon of coconut oil and a sprinkle of salt. Toss until lightly coated, and arrange them in a single layer.
 - Roast the sweet potatoes on the middle rack for about 35 minutes, tossing halfway, and roast the peppers on the top rack for about 20 minutes, tossing halfway. The vegetables will be tender and caramelized on the edges when they are ready.
