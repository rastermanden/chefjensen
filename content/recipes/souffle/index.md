yield: 8
prepTime: 15
cookTime: 40

ingredients:

- 3 tablespoons finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
- 1 1/4 cups finely chopped cauliflower florets
- 1/4 cup finely chopped flat-leaf parsley
- White pepper to taste
- 1/2 stick unsalted butter
- 4 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 1/2 cups whole milk
- 6 large egg yolks
- 8 large egg whites
- For brown butter:1 stick salted butter
directions:
- Preheat oven to 200°C with rack in middle.
- Generously butter soufflé dish, then sprinkle with cheese, knocking out excess.
- Stir together cauliflower, parsley, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and white pepper to taste in a large bowl.
- Melt butter in a 2- to 3-quart heavy saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in flour, then cook, whisking, until pale golden, about 2 minutes. Add milk a little at a time, whisking constantly until very smooth.
- Bring sauce to a boil, whisking, then simmer, whisking, until quite thick, about 1 minute.
- Remove from heat and whisk in yolks, 1/4 teaspoon white pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Stir into cauliflower mixture.
- Beat whites in a bowl with an electric mixer at high speed until they just hold stiff peaks (they should not look dry).
- Stir a heaping spoonful of whites into yolk mixture to lighten, then gently fold in remaining whites until just combined.
- Gently spoon into soufflédish (leave at least 1 inches of space at top) and bake until golden brown and top appears set, 35 to 40 minutes.
